# Hello 👋🏻

I am Héctor, a software developer who in my free time likes to create software to solve real problems, big or small (usually small).

Check out some of my projects, like 🏆 [Rafflr](https://rafflr.codesharegrow.net), the library it uses, 🎲 [shufflr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shufflr) ([also available in Rust](https://crates.io/crates/shufflr)), and an old one related to IoT, 🌡️ [py-temperature-recorder](https://github.com/hectortosa/py-temperature-recorder#readme).

You can reach me on <a rel="me" href="https://toot.thoughtworks.com/@hectortortosa">Mastodon</a>.
